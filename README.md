This is a fork of https://github.com/FriendsOfSylius/SyliusImportExportPlugin

It has been customized for inGem's specific needs.

Installation instructions (and an additional CSV conversion script) are here:
https://gitlab.com/challengersports/ingem/shop/plugin-import-export-data

Perhaps that ^ repo is where this customized plugin should actually live, but I think we will then be severed from pushing any improvements back to the original. Although that ship may have sailed anyway.
